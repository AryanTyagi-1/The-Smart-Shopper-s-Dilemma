# The-Smart-Shopper-s-Dilemma
We are building a system for a smart shopping assistant. A user types in a product name — say, “365 WholeFoods Peanut Butter”. They expect our system to instantly fetch all relevant product cards from Google Shopping: product name, brand, price, and total weight.
# Smart Shopper’s Django API
Get real-time product data (name, brand, price, weight) from Google Shopping by querying a single API endpoint. High performance with async scraping and caching.
